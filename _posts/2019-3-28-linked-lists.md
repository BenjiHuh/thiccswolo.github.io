title: Linked Lists

It's basically a different type of data set. Each peice of information is it's own object. The best analogy of this is a train. You have a train that has a rear end, a middle that has cargo, and a node that hooks to other trains. With a train, you can simply switch it's position by switching the trains and hooking up the nodes with the other trains. With linked lists, you have advantages and disadvantages. The first advantage is the ability to move around objects in a list with maximum efficency. It's as simple as changing the node of objects. But a clear disadvantage is when you want the information of an object, or you want to change the object.The more items you have, the longer it takes to reassign or identify the contents of an object.
