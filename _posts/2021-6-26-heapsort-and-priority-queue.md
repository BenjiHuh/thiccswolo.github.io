title: Heapsort and Priority Queues
---

Heap sort is a sorting method that is mainly used from binary heap data structures. In order to get a better understanding of Heap Sort and Priority Queue, it will help 
to know the following concepts; a complete binary tree, how heaps are represented in an array, and max and min heap. All these concepts can be thoroughly in Abdul Bari's lecture on Heap:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqPJF2L5h9U

Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order: 
1. Build a max heap from the input given.
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. 
Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 
3. Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater than 1.

This is some example code in Java from the Geeksforgeeks Website;

```java
// Java program for implementation of Heap Sort
public class HeapSort
{
    public void sort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
  
        // Build heap (rearrange array)
        for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            heapify(arr, n, i);
  
        // One by one extract an element from heap
        for (int i=n-1; i>=0; i--)
        {
            // Move current root to end
            int temp = arr[0];
            arr[0] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
  
            // call max heapify on the reduced heap
            heapify(arr, i, 0);
        }
    }
  
    // To heapify a subtree rooted with node i which is
    // an index in arr[]. n is size of heap
    void heapify(int arr[], int n, int i)
    {
        int largest = i;  // Initialize largest as root
        int l = 2*i + 1;  // left = 2*i + 1
        int r = 2*i + 2;  // right = 2*i + 2
  
        // If left child is larger than root
        if (l < n && arr[l] > arr[largest])
            largest = l;
  
        // If right child is larger than largest so far
        if (r < n && arr[r] > arr[largest])
            largest = r;
  
        // If largest is not root
        if (largest != i)
        {
            int swap = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[largest];
            arr[largest] = swap;
  
            // Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
            heapify(arr, n, largest);
        }
    }
  
    /* A utility function to print array of size n */
    static void printArray(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
        System.out.println();
    }
  
    // Driver program
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
        int n = arr.length;
  
        HeapSort ob = new HeapSort();
        ob.sort(arr);
  
        System.out.println("Sorted array is");
        printArray(arr);
    }
}
```
